    "#### -- Why Are Restaurant Analytics Important?\n",
    "    Business analytics for opening restaurants is integral to understanding the inner workings of the business and being aware of how the owner can improve it to foster a sustainable level of success. By working with relevant data, the owner should be able to track, monitor, and measure the most valuable business insights in a way that is clear, concise, and digestible, pulling from past, present, and predictive data. This will enable sustainable KPI management processes that will ultimately increase productivity and save money."
